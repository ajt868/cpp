Awesome choice! A **Quiz App** is a great beginner-to-intermediate project that helps you learn:

* File I/O (reading quiz questions)
* Data structures (storing questions/answers)
* Control flow (score tracking, question flow)
* Optionally: timing and randomization

## üß© Step-by-Step Plan for Your Quiz App

We‚Äôll make a **console-based quiz app** first. Here's what it will do:

1. Read quiz questions from a file
2. Ask the user each question with multiple-choice options
3. Accept the user's answer
4. Track and display the score at the end

---

## üìÅ Step 1: Create Your Project Files

```
quiz-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ questions.txt
```

---

## üìù `questions.txt` ‚Äî Sample Question Format

We'll use a simple format like:

```
What is the capital of France?
a) Berlin
b) Madrid
c) Paris
d) Rome
c

What is 2 + 2?
a) 3
b) 4
c) 5
d) 22
b
```

Each question is 6 lines:

1. Question
   2‚Äì5. Options (a, b, c, d)
2. Correct option letter (`a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`)

## üß† Step 2: Write the Core Logic (`main.cpp`)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

struct Question {
    std::string text;
    std::string options[4];
    char correct;
};

std::vector<Question> loadQuestions(const std::string& filename) {
    std::vector<Question> questions;
    std::ifstream file(filename);
    if (!file) {
        std::cerr << "Could not open file: " << filename << std::endl;
        return questions;
    }

    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(file, line)) {
        Question q;
        q.text = line;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            std::getline(file, q.options[i]);
        }
        file >> q.correct;
        file.ignore(); // to skip newline after the answer
        questions.push_back(q);
    }

    return questions;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<Question> quiz = loadQuestions("questions.txt");

    int score = 0;
    for (const auto& q : quiz) {
        std::cout << "\n" << q.text << "\n";
        for (const auto& opt : q.options) {
            std::cout << opt << "\n";
        }

        std::cout << "Your answer: ";
        char ans;
        std::cin >> ans;

        if (tolower(ans) == tolower(q.correct)) {
            std::cout << "Correct!\n";
            ++score;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Wrong! Correct answer was: " << q.correct << "\n";
        }
    }

    std::cout << "\nYou scored " << score << " out of " << quiz.size() << "!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

---

## üß™ Step 3: Compile and Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o quiz
./quiz
```

---

## üöÄ Optional Features You Can Add Later

* Timer (using `<chrono>`)
* Randomize questions
* High scores saved to a file
* Categories or difficulty levels

---

Would you like me to help you add **timing**, **categories**, or turn it into a **GUI with Qt** next?
